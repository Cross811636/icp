h2. Implementation of an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm

This is an implementation of the ICP algorithm given in Lu & Milios, "Robot Pose Estimation in Unknown Environments by Matching 2D Range Scans". It can be used to find the rotation and transform that gives a locally optimal alignment of one set of points with another. The actual algorithm consists of three subalgorithms:

# SLSMA

# IMRP

# ICP (confusing, I know)
